👋 Hey, I'm Asad Rasool

Full-Stack Web Developer | Architecture Enthusiast | Clean Code Advocate

I build web apps that are fast, secure, and easy to maintain. Lately I'm focused on scalable architecture — designing systems that grow without becoming unmanageable. I like understanding why things work, not just how.

🚀 Tech I Work With

Frontend:
HTML, CSS, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, React

Backend:
Node.js, Express.js, PHP

Databases:
MySQL, MongoDB (Mongoose)

CMS & Platforms:
WordPress — theme & plugin development, custom Gutenberg blocks, headless WordPress with React

Other Skills:
REST APIs, Authentication, WebSockets, System Design Basics, Deployment & DevOps fundamentals

🧠 What I’m Currently Learning

Scalable application architecture and system design

Designing secure, maintainable backend systems

Best practices for modular code and folder structure

Real-time systems (WebSockets), performance tuning, and resilient services

🛠 What I Like Building

Responsive, accessible UIs and component-driven frontends

Secure, well-documented backend APIs and microservices

Real-time features: live chat, notifications, and multiplayer logic

Full-stack dashboards and admin tools

WordPress solutions — from custom themes and plugins to headless setups backed by React

🔥 My Developer Mindset

I aim for code and systems that are:

Readable — so teammates can jump in without pain

Scalable — designed for growth, not duct-taped later

Maintainable — organized, modular, and well-tested

Secure — protect user data and follow best practices

I prefer designing the architecture up front — it saves time and keeps projects sane as they grow.

🤝 Let’s Connect

I’m open to collaboration, architecture reviews, WordPress work, or pairing on projects. Always up for a good technical deep-dive.
